# TODO
As a simple way to practice JS and walk through the things I find important to know from vanilla JS to ReactJS, I've created this project that will be my log while I move a simple TODO project from 1 JS file to modularised, with tests and ReactJS.

## Running the tests
```
npm test
```

## Going MVC
The first PR is the beginning to start moving towards mvc approach with vanilla JS.
