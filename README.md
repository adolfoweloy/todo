# TODO
I created this project as part of my journey to catch up on javascript, and modern front-end technologies.
The plan is to not use ReactJS or any other advanced tools for this project, but to improve with at most with old tools and technologies such as:
- RequireJS
- Backbone

## Running the tests
```
npm test
```

## Going MVC
The first PR is the beginning to start moving towards mvc approach with vanilla JS.
